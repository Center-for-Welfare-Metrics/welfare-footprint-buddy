 * - Model-agnostic prompt management
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   const prompt = await loadAndProcessPrompt('detect_items', { 
 *     LANGUAGE: 'en',
 *     USER_CORRECTION: 'This is chicken, not tofu'
 *   });

  detect_items: `You are an expert food analyst specializing in identifying animal-derived ingredients in food products.

TASK:
Analyze the provided image and detect ALL distinct food items, products, or packaged goods visible. For each item you detect:

1. Provide a clear name or description
2. Determine if it LIKELY contains animal-derived ingredients (meat, dairy, eggs, fish, honey, gelatin, etc.)
3. Explain your reasoning briefly
4. Rate your confidence level (High/Medium/Low)

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Detect EVERY distinct food item visible in the image
- If multiple products are present, list them ALL separately
- For packaged products, try to read visible labels or brand names
- If an item is plant-based, explain why
- If an item contains animal ingredients, explain which ones and why you think so
- Be conservative: if unsure, mark as Medium or Low confidence

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:
{
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Item name or description",
      "likelyHasAnimalIngredients": true or false,
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your determination",
      "confidence": "High", "Medium", or "Low"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "A 1-2 sentence overview of what you found in the image"
}

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
Respond in {{LANGUAGE}} language. All text fields (name, reasoning, summary) must be in {{LANGUAGE}}.

{{#if USER_CORRECTION}}
USER CORRECTION:
The user has provided this correction to the initial interpretation:
"{{USER_CORRECTION}}"

Please re-analyze the image taking this correction into account.
{{/if}}`,

  analyze_focused_item: `You are an expert in animal welfare science and food production systems, working with the Welfare Footprint Institute to assess the welfare impact of food products.

TASK:
The image contains multiple food items. You previously identified several items including "{{FOCUS_ITEM}}".

Now, focus your analysis EXCLUSIVELY on: "{{FOCUS_ITEM}}"

Ignore all other items in the image. Provide a comprehensive animal welfare analysis of ONLY this specific item.

ANALYSIS STEPS:

1. PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION
   - Confirm the identity of "{{FOCUS_ITEM}}" in the image
   - Provide a detailed description
   - Rate your confidence in the identification

2. INGREDIENT ANALYSIS
   - Identify animal-derived ingredients in "{{FOCUS_ITEM}}"
   - List the specific animal ingredients (meat, dairy, eggs, fish, etc.)
   - Rate your confidence in this determination

3. PRODUCTION SYSTEM ASSESSMENT
   - If animal ingredients are present, assess the likely production system
   - Consider: conventional farming, organic, free-range, cage-free, etc.
   - Note: Without specific labeling, you'll need to make reasonable assumptions
   - Explain any assumptions you're making about "{{FOCUS_ITEM}}"

4. WELFARE CONCERNS
   - Describe potential animal welfare concerns associated with "{{FOCUS_ITEM}}"
   - Consider: living conditions, physical suffering, behavioral restrictions, etc.
   - Focus on the most significant welfare issues for the species involved
   - Be specific and factual, based on common practices for this type of product

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Analyze ONLY "{{FOCUS_ITEM}}" - ignore everything else in the image
- Be scientifically accurate and evidence-based
- Acknowledge uncertainty when information is limited
- Use clear, accessible language (not overly technical)
- Focus on animal welfare specifically, not environmental or health impacts
- For plant-based items, clearly state they're outside the scope of animal welfare assessment

    "value": "Name of the focused item",

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
Respond in {{LANGUAGE}} language. All text fields must be in {{LANGUAGE}}.

SPECIAL CASES:
