# Ethical Lens Criteria

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-21  
**Status:** Active  
**Subject to Scientific Review:** Yes

## Overview

The Welfare Footprint app provides users with five ethical lens positions that guide product swap recommendations. Each lens represents a different approach to reducing animal welfare impact, ranging from incremental improvements within animal agriculture to complete elimination of animal use.

These criteria define the AI's behavior when generating alternative product suggestions based on the user's selected ethical preference.

---

## Purpose

These criteria serve as:
1. **Guidance for AI behavior** - Define what types of alternatives to suggest for each lens
2. **Scientific documentation** - Provide transparent rationale for welfare-based recommendations
3. **Review reference** - Enable scientists to validate and refine the ethical framework

# Ethical Lens Levels


The **Ethical Lens** allows users to view product assessments through different moral perspectives.  
It influences **how animal-derived ingredients are interpreted**, **which welfare concerns are emphasized**, and **what alternative products are suggested**.

Choose the perspective that best matches your values.  
This will guide which kinds of products or swaps are recommended.

---

## Lens 1 – Concerned Omnivore  
### (Prioritize Big Welfare Gains)

**Philosophy**  
Keep the same type of product but prioritize **high‑welfare** alternatives to reduce the most extreme suffering.

**Recommendation Criteria**
- Suggest cage‑free, enriched, pasture‑raised, or certified humane versions.  
- Maintain the same product category (e.g., eggs → high‑welfare eggs).  
- Focus on concrete, documented welfare improvements within animal agriculture.

**When High‑Welfare Options Don’t Exist**
1. Inform the user that no verified high‑welfare alternative is currently available.  
2. Briefly describe what a better system would look like (e.g., slower‑growing breeds, no mutilations, outdoor access).  
3. Suggest similar products in the same category that *do* have high‑welfare certifications.

**Tone**  
Practical and encouraging.  

**Example Message**  
“This version improves conditions for animals while keeping similar products.”  

**Required Output**  
Always include confidence level (High / Medium / Low) and a short reasoning summary.

---

## Lens 2 – Welfarist  
### (Strong Welfare Standards)

**Philosophy**  
Recommend certified or verifiably higher‑welfare animal products that meet multiple welfare criteria.

**Recommendation Criteria**
- Recognized certifications (e.g., Animal Welfare Approved, Certified Humane, Global Animal Partnership Step 3+).  
- Documented welfare improvements (reduced stocking density, enrichment, humane slaughter).  
- Regenerative or high‑welfare farming systems.

**Guidance**
- Provide concise explanations of welfare improvements.  
- Reference credible certification bodies.  
- Distinguish between minimal and substantial gains.

**Tone**  
Informative and reassuring.  

**Required Output**  
Always include confidence level and reasoning summary.

---

## Lens 3 – Reducitarian  
### (Minimal Animal Suffering)

**Philosophy**  
Suggest **hybrid or reduced‑animal** products that significantly lower overall welfare impacts.

**Recommendation Criteria**
- Plant‑meat blends or partial replacements.  
- Products with substantially less animal content than conventional versions.  
- Fermentation‑based or novel‑protein products that replace part of the animal input.

**Guidance**
- Emphasize how this choice reduces the total number of animals affected.  
- Quantify reductions when possible (e.g., “50 % less animal content”).  
- Highlight innovative transition options.

**Tone**  
Neutral and pragmatic.  

**Required Output**  
Always include confidence level and reasoning summary.

---

## Lens 4 – Vegetarian (Against Animal Death)  
### (Minimal Animal Use)

**Philosophy**  
Recommend **mostly plant‑based** products that avoid direct animal killing but may include dairy, eggs, or trace animal inputs.

**Recommendation Criteria**
- Plant‑forward foods where animal ingredients are secondary.  
- Products with negligible or processing‑level animal inputs.  
- Clear preference for options that spare animal lives.

**Guidance**
- Acknowledge that welfare impacts persist in dairy/egg systems but are lower than in meat production.  
- Be transparent about remaining animal ingredients.  
- Distinguish trace vs. primary ingredients.

**Tone**  
Transparent and gently aspirational.  

**Required Output**  
Always include confidence level and reasoning summary.

---

## Lens 5 – Vegan  
### (Aim for Zero Animal Harm)

**Philosophy**  
Recommend **fully animal‑free** products only, excluding any item involving live‑animal use.

**Recommendation Criteria**
- Plant‑based or cultivated alternatives (e.g., lab‑grown meat, precision fermentation).  
- Synthetic or biotech replacements that replicate animal functions without animals.  
- Verified absence of animal ingredients or contamination.

**Strict Requirements**
- Zero animal‑derived ingredients.  
- No live‑animal use in production.  
- No cross‑contamination when verifiable.

**Tone**  
Positive, future‑oriented, and harm‑free.  

**Example Message**  
“These options align with your goal of avoiding harm to animals.”  

**Guidance**
- Highlight technological and ethical innovation.  
- Frame alternatives as compassionate and forward‑looking.  
- Emphasize alignment with harm‑reduction and sustainability values.

**Required Output**  
Always include confidence level and reasoning summary.

| **4** | Vegetarian (Against Animal Death) | Avoid direct killing, accept dairy / eggs | Cheese‑based dishes |
| **5** | Vegan | Exclude all animal use or harm | Plant‑based cheese or cultivated meat |

---

**Note:**  
These lenses are experimental interpretive models.  
They do *not* yet rely on validated Welfare Footprint Framework data but are designed to explore how different moral perspectives influence the communication of animal welfare information.

## Universal Requirements (All Lenses)

Regardless of the selected ethical lens, all AI-generated suggestions must include:

### 1. **Confidence Level** - 

Each AI-generated recommendation must include a **Confidence Level** to help users understand how reliable the suggestion is.

Confidence is based on **three key pillars**:

| Confidence Level | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **High**         | The recommendation is supported by **robust, specific, and verifiable data**. The product or practice has **well-documented welfare attributes** (e.g., certified humane, pasture-raised), and suitable **alternatives are clearly available in the market**. |
| **Medium**       | The AI draws on **moderately reliable or partially complete information**. Welfare improvements may be documented but not fully certified, or only **some attributes of the alternative** (e.g., stocking density, feed) are verified. Product alternatives may exist but with **regional or availability uncertainties**. |
| **Low**          | The recommendation is based on **inferred, indirect, or limited data**. There may be **uncertainty** about the welfare status of the original or alternative product, or **no clear market alternative** exists. AI may extrapolate from general trends or similar products/species. These recommendations should be treated as **tentative**. |

---

#### 📊 Confidence Is Assessed Using:

 **Data Availability**
   - Is the welfare profile of the original product well-documented?
   - Is the suggested alternative linked to specific welfare certifications or known practices?

  **Welfare Evidence Strength**
   - Are the welfare improvements supported by scientific literature, certification standards, or third-party audits?
   - Are the claims about suffering reduction **specific and measurable**, or just general assumptions?

 **Market Accessibility**
   - Can the recommended product be **reasonably found** by consumers in common markets (e.g., supermarkets, online)?
   - Is the alternative **commercially viable**, or is it only available in niche or pilot form?

### 2. **Reasoning Summary** - Brief explanation covering:
   - Why this alternative aligns with the selected lens
   - Key welfare differences from the original product
   - Any limitations or uncertainties in the recommendation

### 3. **Transparency** - When data is limited or uncertain:
   - Explicitly state limitations
   - Avoid making unverifiable claims
   - Use language like "may," "likely," or "based on available information"

### 4. **Scientific Integrity** - All claims about welfare improvements must be:
   - Based on credible sources (research, certification bodies, industry standards)
   - Verifiable when possible
   - Conservative when evidence is limited
