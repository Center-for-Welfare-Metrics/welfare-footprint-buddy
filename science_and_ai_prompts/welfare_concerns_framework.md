**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-21  
**Status:** Active  
**Subject to Scientific Review:** Yes

## Overview

This document defines the framework for identifying, categorizing, and communicating animal welfare concerns associated with food products. It provides scientific criteria for assessing the severity and prevalence of welfare issues across different production systems and species.

---

## Purpose

This framework serves to:
1. **Guide welfare assessment** - Provide structured approach to identifying welfare concerns
2. **Ensure consistency** - Standardize how welfare issues are categorized and described
3. **Prioritize concerns** - Help focus on the most significant welfare issues
4. **Support transparency** - Enable clear communication of welfare implications to users

## Categories of Welfare Concerns

### 1. Living Conditions

**Definition:** Physical environment and housing conditions experienced by animals

**Key Welfare Issues:**

**Space Restrictions:**
- Inability to turn around or move freely
- Severe crowding and high stocking density
- Permanent confinement in cages or crates
- Lack of individual space or resting areas

**Environmental Deficiencies:**
- Poor air quality (ammonia, dust, poor ventilation)
- Inadequate temperature regulation
- Lack of natural light
- Monotonous or barren environments
- No access to outdoors or fresh air

**Housing-Related Injuries:**
- Injuries from cage wires or slatted floors
- Pressure sores from inability to move
- Foot and leg problems from inappropriate flooring
- Skin conditions from poor bedding or cleanliness

**Species-Specific Examples:**
- Laying hens in battery cages: Cannot spread wings, perform nesting behavior
- Pigs in gestation crates: Cannot turn around for months
- Dairy cattle in tie-stalls: Restricted movement for extended periods
- Broiler chickens: High density causes trampling, heat stress

---

### 2. Physical Suffering

**Definition:** Direct physical pain, injury, or disease experienced by animals

**Key Welfare Issues:**

**Painful Procedures:**
- Debeaking/beak trimming (poultry) without anesthesia
- Tail docking (pigs, cattle) without pain relief
- Castration without anesthesia
- Dehorning/disbudding (cattle) without pain relief
- Teeth clipping (pigs)
- Toe trimming (poultry)

**Breeding-Related Suffering:**
- Fast growth rates causing leg problems and heart failure (broiler chickens)
- Mastitis and lameness from high milk production (dairy cattle)
- Reproductive exhaustion (laying hens, dairy cattle)
- Skeletal problems from selective breeding
- Metabolic disorders from intensive production

**Disease and Injury:**
- Respiratory diseases from poor air quality
- Infections from crowding and poor hygiene
- Injuries from aggressive interactions (due to stress)
- Untreated illness or injury
- Parasitic infections

**Slaughter Concerns:**
- Pre-slaughter stress (transport, lairage, handling)
- Ineffective stunning (consciousness during bleeding)
- Rough handling causing fear and injury
- Poor slaughter practices

**Species-Specific Examples:**
- Broiler chickens: Leg deformities from rapid growth; heart failure
- Laying hens: Osteoporosis from calcium depletion; keel bone fractures
- Dairy cattle: Mastitis; lameness; metabolic diseases
- Pigs: Tail biting; injuries from aggressive interactions in crowded conditions

---

### 3. Behavioral Restrictions

**Definition:** Inability to perform natural, species-specific behaviors critical for wellbeing

**Key Welfare Issues:**

**Restricted Movement:**
- Inability to walk, run, or exercise
- Cannot turn around or change position
- Forced to remain in one location
- Limited ability to escape threats or avoid aggression

**Thwarted Natural Behaviors:**
- Cannot forage or explore (most species)
- Cannot nest or build nests (laying hens, pigs)
- Cannot perch or fly (poultry)
- Cannot root or dig (pigs)
- Cannot graze or browse (ruminants)
- Cannot dust-bathe (poultry)
- Cannot engage in social behaviors appropriately

**Social Disruption:**
- Forced separation from offspring (dairy cattle)
- Abnormal group sizes (too large or too small)
- Inability to establish natural social hierarchies
- Forced proximity causing stress and aggression
- Social isolation (veal calves, some pig systems)

**Reproductive and Parental Behavior:**
- Inability to perform mating behaviors naturally
- Separation of mothers from offspring shortly after birth
- Inability to care for young
- Artificial insemination causing stress

**Species-Specific Examples:**
- Laying hens: Cannot build nests before laying (causes severe frustration)
- Sows: Cannot build farrowing nest; confined during birth and nursing
- Dairy cows: Calves removed within hours/days of birth
- Broiler breeders: Severe feed restriction to prevent obesity (chronic hunger)

---

### 4. Psychological Distress

**Definition:** Mental suffering including fear, chronic stress, frustration, and boredom

**Key Welfare Issues:**

**Chronic Stress:**
- Constant fear or anxiety
- Unpredictable or uncontrollable environment
- Social stress from crowding or aggression
- Separation distress
- Anticipation of painful procedures

**Frustration:**
- Inability to perform highly motivated behaviors (nesting, foraging, etc.)
- Thwarted escape attempts
- Inability to avoid aversive situations

**Boredom and Depression:**
- Lack of environmental stimulation
- No opportunity for exploration or play
- Monotonous conditions without change
- Learned helplessness

**Fear and Anxiety:**
- Rough handling by workers
- Transport stress
- Novel or threatening environments
- Anticipation of slaughter

**Abnormal Behaviors (indicating distress):**
- Stereotypies (repetitive, purposeless behaviors)
- Self-harm (feather pecking, tail biting)
- Excessive aggression
- Withdrawal and apathy

**Species-Specific Examples:**
- Pigs: Tail biting, bar biting (stereotypy)
- Chickens: Feather pecking, cannibalism (in barren conditions)
- Cattle: Tongue rolling, bar licking (stereotypy)
- Mink (farmed): Repetitive pacing (stereotypy)

## Severity Assessment

### High Severity Concerns

**Characteristics:**
- Cause intense or prolonged pain
- Severely restrict fundamental behaviors
- Result in chronic suffering
- Have high prevalence in the production system
- Are inherent to the system (not accidents)

**Examples:**
- Battery cage confinement (laying hens)
- Gestation crate confinement (pigs)
- Painful procedures without anesthesia
- Severe lameness or metabolic disease
- Cannibalism or severe aggression

**Communication Approach:**
- Emphasize severity and prevalence
- Be specific about the nature of suffering
- Connect to production system clearly

---

### Moderate Severity Concerns

**Characteristics:**
- Cause periodic or moderate pain/distress
- Restrict some but not all natural behaviors
- Result in episodic suffering
- Affect a significant proportion of animals
- Can be mitigated but often aren't

**Examples:**
- High stocking density in cage-free barns
- Limited outdoor access in "free-range" systems
- Transport stress
- Social stress from large group sizes
- Minor injuries from housing conditions

**Communication Approach:**
- Acknowledge the concern without overstating
- Explain frequency and scope
- Note when mitigation is possible

---

### Lower Severity Concerns

**Characteristics:**
- Cause minimal pain or distress
- Minor behavioral restrictions
- Rare or infrequent occurrence
- Largely mitigated in higher-welfare systems

**Examples:**
- Brief handling stress (in low-stress handling systems)
- Minor environmental fluctuations
- Occasional minor injuries
- Short-term dietary changes

**Communication Approach:**
- Mention if relevant but don't overemphasize
- Acknowledge these are relatively minor
- Note when systems effectively address these

---

## Prioritization Guidelines

### Focus on Most Significant Issues

**When analyzing welfare concerns:**
1. **Prioritize by severity and prevalence**
   - High severity + high prevalence = Highest priority
   - High severity + low prevalence = High priority
   - Moderate severity + high prevalence = Moderate priority
   - Low severity issues = Mention only if space permits

2. **Prioritize by species-relevance**
   - Focus on issues most critical for the specific species
   - Consider what behaviors are most important for that species' wellbeing

3. **Prioritize by system-specific issues**
   - Highlight concerns inherent to the identified production system
   - Note when certain issues are avoided in higher-welfare systems

**Example Prioritization:**
For battery cage eggs:
1. **Highest Priority:** Severe space restriction (cannot spread wings, move freely)
2. **High Priority:** Cannot perform nesting behavior (causes acute frustration)
3. **High Priority:** Skeletal problems from lack of movement
4. **Moderate Priority:** Poor air quality in large sheds
5. **Lower Priority:** Brief handling stress during collection (if relevant)

## Communication Standards

### Be Specific and Factual

**Do:**
- Describe concrete conditions: "confined in cages approximately 67 square inches per bird"
- Explain specific behaviors restricted: "unable to spread wings, nest, or dustbathe"
- Reference common practices: "debeaking typically performed without anesthesia"

**Don't:**
- Use vague terms: "poor conditions", "bad treatment"
- Use overly emotional language: "tortured", "horrific"
- Make unverifiable claims: "all animals are severely abused"

### Use Accessible Language

**Do:**
- Use clear, simple terms: "living conditions", "space to move"
- Explain technical terms briefly: "gestation crates (small metal enclosures)"
- Keep sentences straightforward

**Don't:**
- Use overly technical jargon without explanation
- Assume user knowledge of farming practices
- Use academic or scientific terminology excessively

### Acknowledge Uncertainty

**When information is limited:**
- State: "based on typical practices in this system"
- Use: "likely", "commonly", "often" (not "always" or "never")
- Note: "without visible labeling, specific conditions cannot be determined"

**Example:**
"Without specific welfare certification, this product likely comes from conventional egg production, which typically involves high stocking density and limited behavioral freedom. Specific conditions cannot be verified without additional product information."
