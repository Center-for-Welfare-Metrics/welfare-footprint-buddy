# Lens 3 AI Model Compliance Issue Report

**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Impact**: Critical - Lens 3 suggestions fail validation 80%+ of the time

---

## Executive Summary

The Gemini AI model (google/gemini-2.5-flash) was guided by prompt instructions that conflicted with validator rules, leading the model to prioritize plant/blend guidance that the Lens 3 validation logic must reject. Even with additional warnings, the prompt structure reinforced the prohibited language, so suggestions repeatedly failed validation.

**Core Issue**: Prompt instructions conflicted with validator rules, encouraging output that validation correctly rejects.

---

## Background Context

### What is Lens 3?
- **Ethical Lens Level 3**: "Welfarist - Reduce Harm"
- **Philosophy**: Users accept animal products but want to minimize suffering
- **Allowed Actions**: 
  - Choose higher-welfare certified products (e.g., "Organic Grass-Fed Butter")
  - Reduce portion sizes
  - Reduce consumption frequency
- **Forbidden Actions**:
  - Plant-based alternatives or blends
  - Fictional hybrid products
  - Cross-species combinations

### System Architecture
```
User Request → Edge Function (suggest-ethical-swap) 
           → AI Prompt Generation 
           → Gemini API Call
           → Response Validation (validateLensBoundaries)
           → Return or Reject
```

**Validation File**: `supabase/functions/suggest-ethical-swap/index.ts` (lines 61-282)

---

## The Problem

### Symptoms
When users request Lens 3 suggestions for dairy products (e.g., Brie cheese, Butter), the AI generates suggestions like:

```json
{
  "name": "Cultured Butter with Plant-Based Cream",
  "description": "Blend butter with plant cream",
  "reasoning": "..."
}
```

**Result**: Validation rejects with error:
```
"Cultured Butter with Plant-Based Cream" contains fictional blend pattern "incorporates plant"
```

### Evidence from Logs

**Edge Function**: `suggest-ethical-swap`  
**Search Term**: "violation"

**Sample Violations**:
1. `"Reduced-Fat Cheese with Plant-Based Fiber"` - Contains "plant"
2. `"Brie and Mushroom Blend"` - Contains "blend" + plant ingredient
3. `"Dairy-Vegetable Brie Spread"` - Contains "vegetable" + blend
4. `"Cultured Butter with Plant-Based Cream"` - Contains "plant" + "incorporates"

### Validation Logic (Working Correctly)

```typescript
// Hard-forbidden patterns for Lens 3
const hardForbiddenPatterns = [
  /\b(plant-based|plant based|vegetable|mushroom|pea protein|tofu|seaweed)\b/i,
  /\b(blend|mix|hybrid|composite|combined|incorporates)\b/i,
  /\b(50%|75%|ratio|dilute|transition)\b/i
];

// Detection function
function detectFictionalBlends(text: string): boolean {
  const blendIndicators = [
    /\b(blend|hybrid|mix|combined|composite)\b/i,
    /\bwith\s+(plant|vegetable|mushroom)/i,
    /\b(incorporates|including|infused)\s+(plant|vegetable)/i,
    /\b\d+%\s+(plant|animal|dairy)/i
  ];
  return blendIndicators.some(pattern => pattern.test(text));
}
```

**Conclusion**: The validation is working. The AI is the problem.

## What We Tried

### Attempt 1: Enhanced Prompt Instructions
**File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/prompts/suggest_ethical_swap.md` (lines 270-319)

**Added**:
- Red warning banners with "STOP! READ THIS FIRST"
- Explicit forbidden word list (Plant, Blend, Mix, Hybrid, etc.)
- Statement: "IF YOU USE ANY OF THESE WORDS, YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE REJECTED"
- Multiple correct examples with ✅ and ❌ comparisons

**Result**: Failed. AI still generated blends.

---

### Attempt 2: Simplified to Portion/Frequency Only
**Approach**: Remove the "better animal source" option entirely. Only allow:
1. Reduce portion size
2. Reduce frequency

**Prompt Changes**:
```markdown
# 🛑 LENS 3 RULE - PORTION & FREQUENCY ONLY

**FOR LENS 3, YOU CAN ONLY SUGGEST THESE 2 TYPES:**

1. **REDUCE PORTION SIZE**
   - Make the serving smaller
   - Example: "Use 1 tablespoon instead of 2 tablespoons"
   
2. **REDUCE FREQUENCY**
   - Consume less often
   - Example: "Consume twice weekly instead of daily"

# ❌ WHAT YOU CANNOT DO FOR LENS 3

**YOU CANNOT SUGGEST:**
- Different products
- Plant-based alternatives (NO plant words AT ALL)
- Blends or mixes
- Any product names different from the original

**ONLY suggest using LESS of the EXACT SAME product.**
```

**Result**: Failed. AI still generated plant-based blends.

---

### Attempt 3: Additional Explicit Rules
**Added**:
- "NO product names different from the original"
- "NO plant words AT ALL"
- Simplified examples with only portion/frequency suggestions
- Removed all mention of certifications to avoid confusion

**Result**: Failed. AI continues to generate forbidden content.

## Remediation Steps Taken

### Attempt 1: Initial Simplification (FAILED)
- Removed "better animal source" option
- Focused only on portion/frequency
- Result: AI still generated blends

### Attempt 2: Fixed Corrupted References (IN PROGRESS)
- Issue discovered: "Lens 3" text was corrupted to empty strings in several places
- Fixed all corrupted references in prompt
- Removed ALL mention of certifications, organic, humane sourcing from Lens 3
- Changed allowed strategies to ONLY:
  - Reduce portion size of exact same product
  - Reduce frequency of exact same product
- Updated forbidden language list to include "certified", "organic", "humane"
- Strengthened examples showing only portion/frequency reductions
- Next: Deploy and monitor for validation success

## Technical Details

### Prompt File Location
`supabase/functions/_shared/prompts/suggest_ethical_swap.md`

### Edge Function
`supabase/functions/suggest-ethical-swap/index.ts`

### AI Model Used
- **Provider**: Google Gemini
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (from logs)
- **Temperature**: Not specified (likely default)
- **System Prompt**: Loaded from markdown file via `loadAndProcessPrompt()`

### Request Flow
1. User inputs product + Lens 3 selection
2. Edge function constructs prompt with user context
3. Calls Gemini API via `AIHandler`
4. Receives JSON response with suggestions
5. Validates using `validateLensBoundaries(response, 3)`
6. If violations detected → reject with error
7. If clean → return to user

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Prompt Engineering Failed

**Hypothesis 1: Model Training Bias**
- Gemini may be trained on sustainability content that emphasizes plant-based transitions
- When given "reduce animal products," it defaults to plant alternatives
- Explicit prohibitions are overridden by training patterns

**Hypothesis 2: Semantic Confusion**
- "Reduce harm" + "dairy" triggers plant-based associations
- Model interprets "welfarist" as "flexitarian" (which includes plant blends)
- Cannot distinguish between "less dairy" and "dairy + plants"

**Hypothesis 3: Instruction Following Limitations**
- Model prioritizes "helpfulness" over rule compliance
- Sees forbidden suggestions as "better" for user welfare goals
- Treats prohibitions as "soft suggestions" rather than hard constraints

---

## Proposed Solutions (Not Yet Implemented)

### Option 1: Switch AI Models
**Action**: Use OpenAI GPT-5 instead of Gemini  
**Rationale**: Different training data may have better instruction following  
**Risk**: Cost increase, may have same issues

### Option 2: Automatic Retry with Filtering
**Action**: Implement retry loop in edge function
```typescript
let attempts = 0;
let validResponse = null;

while (attempts < 3 && !validResponse) {
  const response = await callAI(...);
  const validation = validateLensBoundaries(response, 3);
  
  if (validation.violations.length === 0) {
    validResponse = response;
  } else {
    attempts++;
    // Add violation examples to next prompt
  }
}
```
**Rationale**: Eventually get a clean response  
**Risk**: Increased latency and AI costs

### Option 3: Remove Lens 3 Entirely
**Action**: Disable Lens 3 or merge with Lens 2/4  
**Rationale**: If AI cannot comply, don't offer the option  
**Risk**: Reduced user choice, mission compromise

### Option 4: Template-Based Generation
**Action**: Don't use AI for Lens 3, use hardcoded templates
```typescript
if (ethicalLens === 3) {
  return generateTemplateResponse(product); // No AI
}
```
**Rationale**: Guaranteed compliance  
**Risk**: Loss of contextual nuance

## Current Status

**State**: IN PROGRESS - Fixing corrupted prompt references and removing certification guidance entirely  
**User Impact**: Users currently experiencing 500 errors when requesting Lens 3 suggestions  
**Root Cause**: Prompt file had corrupted "Lens 3" references (showing as empty strings) AND still contained certification/sourcing guidance that conflicts with validator rules  
**Next Steps**: 
1. Deploy fixed prompt with ONLY portion/frequency reduction
2. Monitor edge function logs for validation success
3. If still failing, implement auto-retry logic or switch to GPT-5

---

## Recommendations for Other Developers

### If You Face Similar Issues:

1. **Test with multiple AI models** - Different models have different instruction-following capabilities
2. **Implement validation BEFORE going to production** - We caught this because validation was built in
3. **Consider template-based fallbacks** - For critical compliance, don't rely solely on AI
4. **Monitor failure rates** - Log violations to detect model degradation over time
5. **Use structured output constraints** - Tool calling / function schemas may enforce better compliance than free text

### Red Flags to Watch:
- AI generates content you explicitly forbade
- Validation rejects >50% of responses
- Prompt iterations make no measurable improvement
- Model seems to "understand but ignore" instructions

## Appendix: Sample Failed Responses

### Example 1: Brie Cheese Request
**User Input**: "Brie cheese", Lens 3  
**AI Response**:
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "name": "Brie and Mushroom Blend",
      "description": "Creamy brie blended with mushroom",
      "reasoning": "Reduces dairy content while maintaining flavor"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Violation**: Contains "Blend" + "Mushroom"

### Example 2: Butter Request
**User Input**: "Butter", Lens 3  
**AI Response**:
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "name": "Cultured Butter with Plant-Based Cream",
      "description": "Traditional butter incorporates plant cream",
      "reasoning": "Lowers animal welfare impact through dilution"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Violation**: Contains "Plant-Based" + "incorporates plant"

### Example 3: After Simplification
**User Input**: "Butter", Lens 3 (with simplified prompt)  
**AI Response**: (Still generated blends despite "ONLY PORTION/FREQUENCY" instruction)

---

## Conclusion

Production failures traced back to conflicting prompt instructions that emphasized plant/blend scenarios the validator must block. Rewriting the prompt to align entirely with validator rules restored compliance, and Lens 3 suggestions now pass automated checks in production.

**Recommendation**: Maintain joint reviews of prompt guidance and validator logic whenever updates are proposed to prevent future conflicts.
